# Exercise Tracker

As someone who trains for marathons and triathlons, I struggled with the little input you could give mainstream exercise apps. Areas like mood and difficulty of the workout things that current apps could not give me. To fix this, I created my own exercise tracker that gives the user more flexibility to describe how they felt, how they felt they performed, and how hard the workout was.

### Folder Descriptions

- **client**: Main code for the front end of the application
  - **index.html**: Contains the HTML formatting for the website
  - **index.js**: Contains logic used for checking where your movie belongs in your timeline and has calls to TMDB API to fetch data for the game
- **public**: Holds styling info
  - **style.css**: Has styling elements used in the website

- **app.js**: Holds all the back end code, this code is used to send data from the client side to the server and then to their opponent. For example, if a player correctly places a movie in order it sends that data to their opponent and tells them how long their opponent's timeline is.
